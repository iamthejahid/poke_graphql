### Project Details:

Project Description: The aim of this project is to develop a Flutter application that allows users to perform read operations on a Pokémon list. The application will utilize a mock GraphQL API to interact with the backend and retrieve Pokémon data.

### Task Requirements:

1.  Home Page:
    
    -   Implement a home page that fetches and displays a list of Pokémon from the GraphQL API.
    -   Display the following details for each Pokémon: name, ID, weight, height, classification, and image.
    -   Provide a scrollable list view to navigate through the Pokémon list.
2.  Detail Page:
    
    -   Implement a detail page for each Pokémon.
    -   When a Pokémon is tapped on the home page, navigate to the detail page to display more information about the selected Pokémon.
    -   Display the following details for the selected Pokémon: name, ID, weight, height, classification, and image.
3.  Integration with Mock GraphQL API:
    
    -   Ensure the application interacts with the provided mock GraphQL API.
    -   Use the provided API URL ([https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/](https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/)) to fetch Pokémon data using GraphQL queries.

  

## Notes

-   This project is built on a personal template and may contain some unnecessary files.
-   It follows a "plug and play" approach, eliminating the need for any special environment setup. However, please note that the required SDK version is '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'.
-   Although a flavor was initially planned, it had to be removed due to time constraints.
- Due to lack of time, mimum ui is used.
- Due to time constraints, the minimum UI design was implemented.
