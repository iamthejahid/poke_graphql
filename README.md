## Getting Started

-   This project is built on a personal template and may contain some unnecessary files.
-   It follows a "plug and play" approach, eliminating the need for any special environment setup. However, please note that the required SDK version is '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'.
-   Although a flavor was initially planned, it had to be removed due to time constraints.
